# Introduction

This project is a extension to Google's game - Ingress. Since there is no official API for this game (so far) and no other way to get more info about players and portals, i decided to create a python "daemon".

We are currently developing Web UI for tgis daemon, so stay tuned.

# Features (what we can get from ingress chat?)

when and where player:
* deployed a resonator
* destroyed a resonator
* created a link
* destroyed a link
* created a field
* destroyed a field
* field decation
* portal mods decation
* player level - based on level of deployed resonator
* notification to any jabber or e-mail about actions (player actions, actions to portal)

All this data stored in MySQL database and you can use it to create:
* heat map of player activity
* heat map of faction activity
* statistics (symmary or daily/monthly)

# Installation

Soon.
